Welcome! These are my self-maintained lists. I try and keep them up to date, but if you see something I need to add, please let me know by opening an issue here: https://github.com/Bryantdl7/pihole-blocklists/issues


If I have a false positive or there is another domain that needs blocking please let me know! https://github.com/Bryantdl7/pihole-blocklists/issues

I'm not great about checking my email, but I'm alive and I use these lists frequently both professionally and at home. If you ever want to text me you can do that through telegram via https://t.me/BRYANTDL7





HELP WANTED - Submit a pull request making these lists more efficient and if they work I will approve the request!
